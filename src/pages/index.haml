    Sass makes CSS fun again.
    Sass is CSS, plus [nested rules](#nesting),
    [variables](#variables), [mixins](#mixins),
    and [more](/docs/yardoc/SASS_REFERENCE.md.html),
    all in a concise, readable syntax.

-# It would be cool if we could have an arrow or something for these
  signifying the transition from CSS to Sass.

  Also, if possible, it would be awesome to use Sass from this site
  for these examples.

    Sass does away with the unnecessary brackets and semicolons of CSS.
    Properties are nested beneath selectors,
    and each property gets its own line.

  %pre.sass
    :preserve
      h1
        height: 118px
        margin-top: 1em

      .tagline
        font-size: 26px
        text-align: right

  %pre.css
    :preserve
      h1 {
        height: 118px;
        margin-top: 1em;
      }

      .tagline {
        font-size: 26px;
        text-align: right;
      }
