  Sass is maintained by [Nathan Weizenbaum](http://nex-3.com) (me)
  and [Chris Eppstein](http://acts-as-architect.blogspot.com),
  and we greatly appreciate any help we can get.
  The official repository is at [github.com/nex3/haml](http://github.com/nex3/haml)
  and most development discussion happens on the [Haml/Sass mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/haml).

  ## Bugs and Features

  If you've found a Sass bug, or you have something you'd like to see in the language,
  by all means speak up!
  Report it on the [issue tracker](http://github.com/nex3/haml/issues)
  and we'll try to follow up with you as soon as we can.
  Please include the following information in your report:

  * What version of Sass you're using (run `sass --version` on the command line)
  * If the issue has to do with Rails, what version of Rails you're using (`rails --version`)
  * A simple Sass stylesheet that displays the bug

  The more information you can provide, the faster it'll be to fix your bug!

  ## Contributing

  While bug reports and feature requests are great,
  actual code fixing the bugs or implementing the features is even better.
  If you've got some code to contribute, first read the information below,
  then fork the [Haml/Sass repository](http://github.com/nex3/haml) and send a pull request.
  We'll do a code review of your patch, and then chances are good we'll merge it right in.

  Sass has two primary branches.
  [stable](http://github.com/nex3/haml/tree/stable) is where the development
  of the released version (currently #{Sass.version[:number]}) takes place.
  This is where most bug fixes should go.
  [master](http://github.com/nex3/haml/tree/master), on the other hand,
  is where the next version of Sass is being developed.
  This is the place for new features.
  Please submit your changes to the appropriate branch.

  When making a patch, please:

  * Make sure your commit message is properly capitalized and punctuated
  * Put "[Sass]" at the beginning of the commit message
    if you're making a change that only affects Sass
  * Add unit tests
  * Add a note to the changelog (`doc-src/SASS_CHANGELOG.md`) describing your change
  * If you're implementing a user-visible change, add it to the reference (`doc-src/SASS_REFERENCE.md`)
