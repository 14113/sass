  Sass is bundled with [Haml](http://haml-lang.com),
  so to get it you'll need to install Haml as well.

  Note that Sass is written in Ruby, so you'll need Ruby installed as well.
  If you're using OS X, it's already there.
  Windows users can get it via [the RubyInstaller for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/download.html).
  Linux users can install it with their package manager.

  ## Standard Gem

  Most people will just want the standard stable Sass gem.
  To install this:

      gem install haml

  ## `haml-edge` Gem

  To get the latest and greatest Sass goodness, though,
  you'll need something else.
  A `haml-edge` gem is created automatically every time changes are made
  to the master branch.
  To install it:

      gem install haml-edge

  Note that `gem "haml-edge"` must be used before `require 'sass'`
  if `haml-edge` is to be used.

  ## Installation from Git

  Haml can also be installed directly from the [Git repository](http://github.com/nex3/haml):

      git clone git://github.com/nex3/haml.git
      cd haml
      rake install

  ## Downloadable Archives

  Finally, archives of current and old releases
  are available on [Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=2760).
