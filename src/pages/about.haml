  Sass is a meta-language on top of CSS
  that's used to describe the style of a document
  cleanly and structurally,
  with more power than flat CSS allows.
  Sass both provides a simpler, more elegant syntax for CSS
  and implements various features that are useful
  for creating manageable stylesheets.

  ## The Sass Team

  Sass was originally created by [Hampton Catlin](http://hamptoncatlin.com),
  and he wrote a proof-of-concept implementation.
  However, now he just occasionally consults on language issues.
  Hampton lives in Jacksonville, Florida and is the lead mobile developer for Wikimedia.

  [Nathan Weizenbaum](http://nex-3.com) is the primary maintainer and designer of Sass.
  His hard work has kept the project alive by endlessly
  answering forum posts, fixing bugs, refactoring, finding speed improvements,
  writing documentation, implementing new features, and planning the future of the language.
  Nathan lives in Seattle, Washington and, while not being a student
  at the University of Washington he consults for Unspace Interactive
  or interns at various software companies.
